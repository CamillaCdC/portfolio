# Harry Potter Portfolio Website

Live app available [here]( http://camillaportfolio.surge.sh/).

Please note: this is still very much a work in progress. Please see below “Features To Come” section. 

## About

I wanted to create a fun interactive portfolio website in React, also trying my hand at some game logic.  Some features I am proud of are: 

* Harry can only move in the paths and cannot walk through characters
* Board, paths and characters are created using SVG’s
* Pop up text (excluding instructions) are created using divs and CSS tricks
* Contact form that connects to a Google Sheet

### Tech Used

* React
* KeyDown Events 


## Features To Come

“Muggle View” 
* Plain view of the information in this website 
* Button to toggle view 

### Bug fixes

* Contact form not resetting after it is sent once
